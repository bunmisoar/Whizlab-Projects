# In the above code, we have declared the resource type as aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment for the environment of the Elastic Beanstalk application. 

# a. solution_stack_name is the name of an environment that Elastic Beanstalk will set up on servers it manages. The solution stack here is 64bit Amazon Linux 2 v3.4.1 running Corretto 17 for Java.

# b. There are other additional settings added for the environment that are required for the environment to launch like Autoscaling Launch configuration, Load balancer, and the minimum and maximum size for the autoscaling group.
